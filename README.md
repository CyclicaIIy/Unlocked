# Unlocked
A simple keybinded external FPS unlocker for ROBLOX.

This may be useless for the average ROBLOX user, but this gives an extremely huge advantage for ROBLOX obbyists as you can immediately switch from 60 to a designated FPS from a set keybind to do certain jumps. This is especially used for speedrunning.

Forked from GreenMs02's External FPSUnlocker
